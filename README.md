In this project I will create a simple educational website using pure HTML and CSS from scratch.
Using a project to apply my CSS skills
This is my first complete UI website using pure CSS
This website has a responsive menu bar that will slide from the right on mobile phones
This is a one page website with home, campuses and other menu links on one page
Creating this project was fun because I got to play around with several CSS properties
